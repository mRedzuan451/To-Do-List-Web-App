## üéØ Project Goals & Learning Outcomes

The primary goal of this project was to solidify my understanding of front-end web development fundamentals. Key learning outcomes include:

* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically creating, reading, updating, and deleting HTML elements using JavaScript.
* **Event Handling:** Capturing and responding to user events like clicks (`click`), keyboard input (`keydown`), and form submissions (`submit`).
* **Client-Side Storage:** Implementing `localStorage` to create a persistent user experience.
* **Modular Code:** Structuring the JavaScript code into clear, reusable functions (e.g., `renderTasks()`, `addTask()`, `toggleComplete()`) for better maintainability.
* **Responsive Web Design:** Using CSS media queries and flexible layouts to ensure a great experience on all screen sizes.
